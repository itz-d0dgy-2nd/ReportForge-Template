# LaTeX

If you find yourself asking: Damn I wish this supports LaTeX. Please action the following:
 1. Fork this repo
 2. Whisper \frac{sadness}{hope} into the void # Yes I know this LaTeX is invalid
 3. Try not to cry. Cry a little anyway.
 4. Either:
   a. Write the LaTeX code for this functionality
   b. Increment the latexDespairCounter and add your github username
 5. Push your branch, and make a PR
